**AdoPokeDemo** is a Windows form application where you can search and check every Pokemon you want to: you have a list of pokemons with unique feature combinations. Each has a name, an element type, a weakness, and an image so you can explore which strategy to follow based on the Pokemon's elements and weaknesses in case you need it, considering you may be playing a Poke game, and probably not have enough knowledge of the strategies, or you just simply are a Pokemon trainer in the real life.
